# The robot takes the silver tokens next to the golden tokens

Here is the flowchart or diagram of the code to grab the silver tokens and release them next to the golden tokens. The robot should enter the origin and find a silver token then take it next to the golden token and do the same in total six times, as there are six pair of tokens. 

According to the diagram, the robot first, enter the origin. Then find the silver token and check the distance if the distance is less than the threshold then grabs it and look for the golden one. if not then check the rotation or the angle and turn according to the angle. After grabbing, check for the golden token and check the distance. Move until the distance is less than one and half time of the threshold as the silver token is between the golden and the robot, if not then you have to check the angle and turn according to angle and move till you reach the one and half time of the threshold to release the silver token next to the golden.
